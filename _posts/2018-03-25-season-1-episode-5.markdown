# Outline

In Episode 5, we interview Katarina Behrens, a consultant and software developers of LibreOffice, LibreOffice extensions and related libraries working at CIB Group of Companies. We discuss her involvement with The Document Foundation, the capabilities of the LibreOffice suite and why an open source office suite is relevant for scientists.

# About Katarina Behrens: 

Katarina Behrens (aka Bubli) is one of LibreOffice core developers.

She got involved with free and open-source software more than a decade ago, 
contributing l10n to Debian project. Employed by SUSE later, she worked on 
YaST, openSUSE's installation and configuration tool and in 2010, she became  
member of SUSE LibreOffice team. 

After a brief intermezzo in computer security business, she was hired by CIB 
(a German company delivering document management systems) in 2015 to 
work on LibreOffice full-time again. Apart from squashing LibreOffice bugs 
that disturb CIB customers' good night's sleep, she engages in mentoring 
(Google Summer of Code) and finds seeing her mentees succeed to be an 
ultimately rewarding experience.
